## **RAID RULES** 

**1.** Raids are always operated in an open, friendly and fun way. Mistakes are encouraged and never punished. We want players to learn, work together and help each other achieve their very best, in an environment where we can laugh and enjoy the game as a team.  

**2.** Players should always be online and ready for invites at 19:45 ST (15 minutes before first pull). 

**3.** The Raid Leader will analyse performance of the team, via logs, and provide feedback, where appropriate, to everyone. This will always be done positively and constructively (see **1.1**), celebrating what went well as well as discussing ways forward. 

**4.** A player will never be made to feel shamed for failing a mechanic (it happens), but you might be asked why it happened! 



## **LOOT** 

**1.** Personal loot applies. Unwanted/duplicate gear must be rolled for to ensure equal opportunity for everyone. We do not use RC Loot Council.

**2.** BoEs dropped during progression go to the GM to sell. Profits go to guild bank to set up a repair fund during raids. 



## **ENCOUNTERS** 

The Raid leader will always explain boss encounters, mechanics and strategies. However, there is an expectation that you at least do some research and come to bosses with a basic understanding of what you have to do. Check the appropriate channels for specific tactics we use.

## SIGNUPS AND ABSENCES

Members can sign up to raids using the Discord-based system in raid-signups. You will not receive an invite if your name is not on the event list. 

Absences happen and that's okay. Please aim to provide 24 hours notice if you can.
