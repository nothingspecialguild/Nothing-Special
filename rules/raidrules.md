## **RAID RULES** 

**1.** Raids are always operated in an open, friendly and fun way. Mistakes are encouraged and never punished. We want players to learn, work together and help each other achieve their very best, in an environment where we can laugh and enjoy the game as a team.  

**2.** Players should always be online and ready for invites at 19:45 ST (15 minutes before first pull). 

**3.** The Raid Leader will analyse performance of the team, via logs, and provide feedback, where appropriate, to everyone. This will always be done positively and constructively (see **1.1**), celebrating what went well as well as discussing ways forward. 

**4.** A player will never be made to feel shamed for failing a mechanic (it happens), but you might be asked why it happened! 



## **LOOT** 

**1.** Personal loot applies. Unwanted/duplicate gear must be rolled for to ensure equal opportunity for everyone. We do not use RC Loot Council.

**2.** BoEs dropped during progression can be kept, if they are an upgrade. You must equip the item during the raid. Unneeded items go to the GM to sell for guild bank funds. 





## **ENCOUNTERS** 

The Raid leader will always explain boss encounters, mechanics and strategies. However, there is an expectation that you at least do some research and come to bosses with a basic understanding of what you have to do. Check the appropriate channels for specific tactics we use.

Voice comms should be kept as clear possible during pulls for the Raid Leader to inform team of tactics and for tanks to communicate with each other.

Only the Raid Leader makes calls during pulls, unless someome else has been designated to help out. 

## SIGNUPS AND ABSENCES

Members can sign up to raids using the Discord-based system in raid-signups. You will not receive an invite if your name is not on the event list. 

Use the absence feature on the sign up sheet to report absences. You can provide a reason via the bot (this will only be shared with officers).

## ATTENDANCE

Members of the raid team are expected to attend all raids, both progression and reclears, with the exception of absences/IRL commitments. 

## RAIDING OUTSIDE OF GUILD RUNS (PUG GROUPS ETC)

We do not prevent guild members from running raids outside of our own scheduled events. 

If you choose to do this, you are still expected to attend raid nights (even if we're clearing bosses you completed).
