## **1. MAIN GUILD RULES** 

We want Nothing Special to be a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere for all players, in every game we play. We do not tolerate egos, toxicity or shouting. 

**1.**    All guild members are expected to treat everybody with the same level of respect they wish to receive.  

**2.**    We never raise our voice, shout or insult other members. 

 **3.**    We do not put other players down. 

**4.**    We all slip up sometimes when things get intense; apologise and acknowledge your mistake if/when this happens. 

**5.**    Racism, sexism, homophobia or any content that directly marginalises a group of people is strictly prohibited.  

**6.**    Keep ‘controversial’ hot topics out the guild. This includes (but is not limited to): politics, commentary on race/sexuality, COVID-19 etc. Take it to Reddit.  

**7.**  No posting of "what does the fox say" content (visual or audio) from Lauren, Jesso or Maria EVER 

We are a diverse group of players that will inevitably have contrasting views on some things sometimes, and that’s okay. But we are adults; we resolve our problems in a mature way. (edited)

## **2. PROBLEM SOLVING**

 Sometimes, arguments happen, people fall out or someone says something you think is hurtful. 
In the first instance, members are encouraged to set aside their differences by themselves. 

**1.**    If you ever have any concerns (with the guild, players or anything else), or believe that what someone said breaks any of our rules, speak to a senior member of the guild to share your grievance.  We want to help! 

**2.**    The GM or Officer will always listen to any problem you have and will highlight what the potential next steps are. 

**3.**    If the issue concerns another player, the senior member will speak to them directly, decide if any rules have been broken, and act accordingly. (edited)



## **3. SANCTIONS** 

**1.** We operate on a three-strike system.  
**2.** Any violation of rule 1.5 will result in immediate dismissal. Rule 3.1 will not apply.
